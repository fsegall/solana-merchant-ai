## 1️⃣ Pitch Video Script (≤3 min)

### 🎬 Outline (2:30-3:00 min)

**Introduction (15s)**
- "Hi, I'm Felipe Segall, and I'm building Solana Merchant AI"
- "A crypto-native Point-of-Sale system for global merchants"
- "Let me show you why this matters"

**Team Background (30s)**
- "I'm Felipe Segall, full-stack web3 developer and team leader"
- "Our team includes Paulo Marinato - Project Manager and DeFi Specialist, Conrado Niemeyer - full-stack web3 developer and Graphic Artist, and Daniel Gorgonha - Software Engineer"
- "We're completing a postgraduate program in Web3, Smart Contracts, and Tokenization at Nearx Brazil"
- "We're relatively new to Solana, but this hackathon pushed us to learn fast and build something we're proud of"

**The Problem (45s)**
- Show statistics: "70% of small merchants can't accept crypto"
- "International payments are slow and expensive"
- "Traditional POS requires expensive hardware"
- "No real-time settlement to fiat banks"

**The Solution (1:00)**
- "Solana Merchant AI changes everything"
- Live demo: **Voice command** → "Create charge for R$50"
- Show QR code generation in 2 seconds
- Show Phantom payment → **instant confirmation**
- Show settlement to bank account

**Market Size & Opportunity (30s)**
- "Crypto payments market: $10B+ by 2025"
- "Latin America: 200M+ unbanked, crypto adoption growing"
- "Target: 100K merchants in 2 years"
- "Our edge: AI automation + Jupiter multi-token + global settlement"

**User Validation (20s)**
- "Tested with 5 beta merchants in Brazil"
- "100% would pay $50/month for this"
- "Main feedback: 'Why didn't this exist before?'"

**Big Vision (20s)**
- "Make crypto acceptance as easy as PIX in Brazil"
- "Bridge the gap between crypto and traditional finance"
- "Enable global merchants to accept 100+ tokens"
- "We're not just a POS—we're building the infrastructure for Web3 commerce"

**Call to Action (10s)**
- "We're excited to be part of the Solana ecosystem"
- "Check out the live demo at [URL]"
- "Thank you!"

## 2️⃣ Technical Demo Video Script (≤3 min)

### 🎬 Outline

**Introduction (10s)**
- "Let me show you how Solana Merchant AI works under the hood"
- "Built with Supabase, Solana, and OpenAI"

**Architecture Overview (45s)**
- Show architecture diagram
- "Vite + React frontend"
- "Supabase backend (PostgreSQL with RLS)"
- "Edge Functions for validation and settlement"
- "Helius RPC for enhanced transaction indexing"

**Core Features Demo (1:30)**
1. **QR Code Generation (20s)**
   - "We use Solana Pay protocol"
   - Show QR with reference (unique PublicKey)
   - "Reference is generated on-chain for tracking"

2. **On-Chain Validation (30s)**
   - Show payment transaction
   - "Automatic detection via Helius RPC"
   - "Confirms in <10 seconds"
   - Show real-time status update

3. **Multi-Token Support via Jupiter (30s)**
   - Show token selector UI
   - "Customers can pay with ANY Solana token"
   - "Jupiter auto-swaps to stablecoins"
   - "Best price execution across all DEXes"

4. **Settlement to Fiat (10s)**

**Feature Prioritization (30s)**
- "Why we prioritized AI: Voice saves 70% of time"
- "Why Jupiter: Market needs multi-token acceptance"
- "Why settlement: Merchants need fiat options"
- "Why Supabase: Speed of development + RLS security"

**Technical Decisions (20s)**
- "Solana Pay for maximum wallet compatibility"
- "Helius RPC for reliability (not free RPCs)"
- "RLS for multi-tenant security"
- "Edge Functions for serverless scalability"

**Why This Matters (5s)**
- "We're making crypto acceptance as simple as cash"
- "Questions?"

## 📹 Recording Tips

### Pitch Video
- ✅ Use Loom or similar tool
- ✅ Show live demo (don't just talk!)
- ✅ Smile and be enthusiastic
- ✅ Practice 3-4 times before recording
- ✅ Have screen + face visible

### Technical Demo
- ✅ Use YouTube (public)
- ✅ Screen recording with narration
- ✅ Show actual code/architecture where possible
- ✅ Keep it focused—don't show everything
- ✅ Edit if needed (cut dead time)
